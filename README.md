## TCC - API :leaves:

This project was made for the Term Paper in Instituto Federal de Educação, Ciência e Tecnologia - Campus Sapucaia do Sul. The main objective was to develop a Blockchain and Smart Contract integrated system for a Digital Legacy solution.

The backend application was made using Spring Boot as the main technology, allied to cyber security processes, such as cryptography. Further on, the Hyperledger Fabric Blockchain and Smart Contracts play a key role in securing the Legacy store and management, alongside the microservices modular API.
